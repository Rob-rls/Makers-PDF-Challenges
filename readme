These are the challenges listed at the end of the Makers Academy PDF challenge.
I've added the numbering to make it easier to match to the .rb files

CHALLENGES
1 Write a method that will tell you if a number is odd or even.
2 Write a method that takes on argument and returns the square of that number.
3 Write a method called ‘shout’ that takes a String as an input and returns that String in
capital letters.
4 Write a ‘greeter’ method that takes a name as an input such that I could write
“greeter(“Jordan”) and it would display “Hello Jordan! How are you today?”
5 Iterate over an Array of numbers to display the square of each number in the Array
6 Iterate over an Array of numbers and only display even numbers (I've included with 5 on my bit of code)
7 Create a hash containing your 5 best friends, with each persons name as the key
and their age as the value. Iterate over that Array to display 5 examples that look like:
“Jordan is 28 years old”
